## Intro

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpeg" >}}

Hello! \
My name is Anton, I am currently 23. I am a passionate programmer and a mathematician from Moscow, Russia. I became interested in programming and It because of my Applied Mathematics education in Wentworth Institute of Technology, located in Boston, MA and I have been doing that for some 4 years by now. Currently looking for a job in the IT sphere in Moscow. If you do have any questions or if you want to hire feel free to contact me.

## Research Interests and Software Skills

In a nutshell, my goal is to start creating new algorithms and mathematical approaches, in different ways to optimize the existing algorithms and to find the general solutions to common problems. I use R, MatLab, LaTeX, Python, and I have basic knowledge of some other languages and programs as well. I am confident with computers, have a bright mind and fast learning skills, motivation and passion.

## Publications

I have two projects done in MatLab, feel free to look at them. \
These are two ways to find a minimum of a non-algebraic function with two variables. This was needed for a real issue of metalworking machines, with a goal to decrease the electricity consumption of an electric drive.
