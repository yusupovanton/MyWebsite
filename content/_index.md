## Intro

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpeg" >}}

Hello! \
My name is Anton, I am currently 23. I am a passionate programmer and a mathematician from Moscow, Russia. I became interested in programming and IT thanks to my Applied Mathematics education in the Wentworth Institute of Technology, located in Boston, MA. I have been learning to code for 4 years by now, but still a newbie :). Currently looking for a job in the IT sphere somewhere in Moscow. If you do have any questions or if you want to hire feel free to contact me.

## Research Interests and Software Skills

In a nutshell, my favourite thing is to create new algorithms and to apply the mathematical approaches in different ways to optimize the existing algorithms and also to find the general solutions to common problems. I use R, MatLab, LaTeX, Python, and I have basic knowledge of some other languages and programs as well. I am confident with computers, have a bright mind and fast learning skills, motivation and passion.

## Publications

I have two projects done in MatLab, but unfortunately they are not available at the moment. Sorry!
