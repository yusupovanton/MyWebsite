## About Me as a person; my first encounter with code

I was born in Moscow, Russia. At the age of 6 my family bought our first computer and I played games that were available for it. I was always wondering: "how on earth could a machine produce a picture? Is it someone inside that decides what picture to show at thhis particular moment?" Later on I would start asking those questions to my parents but they would never know the answer to them, so I had to answer them by myself. My first encounter that I had with the source code of a web page would be when I first tried to tweak around with a website, trying it to shod something different. At the age of 8 I would play around withh windows to reset the machine's password. My parents went mad and had no clue on how to restrict me from going online. My first device was the iPad, and I then learned that every app that was downloaded had it's own unique structure. I was using software on my parent's mac to go inside my iPad and hacked some of the games using Youtube tutorials. \ 
The apps that modern OS offer such as Microsoft Office and other text editing apps, seem really boring and leave less creativity to texts I produce. I now use the knowledge that I gained during my education to make my internet presence more wide. Life quality is something I want to achieve and I hope this website will only grow during time :) \
