<p>I was born in Moscow, Russia. At the age of 6 my family bought our first computer and I played games that were available for it. I was always wondering: &ldquo;how on earth could a machine produce a picture? Is it someone inside that decides what picture to show at thhis particular moment?&rdquo; Later on I would start asking those questions to my parents but they would never know the answer to them, so I had to answer them by myself. My first encounter that I had with the source code of a web page would be when I first tried to tweak around with a website, trying it to shod something different. At the age of 8 I would play around withh windows to reset the machine&rsquo;s password. My parents went mad and had no clue on how to restrict me from going online. My first device was the iPad, and I then learned that every app that was downloaded had it&rsquo;s own unique structure. I was using software on my parent&rsquo;s mac to go inside my iPad and hacked some of the games using Youtube tutorials. \
The apps that modern OS offer such as Microsoft Office and other text editing apps, seem really boring and leave less creativity to texts I produce. I now use the knowledge that I gained during my education to make my internet presence more wide. Life quality is something I want to achieve and I hope this website will only grow during time :) \</p>
